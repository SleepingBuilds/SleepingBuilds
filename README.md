- 👋 Hi, I’m @SleepingBuilds
- 👀 I’m interested in Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ basics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making things with Arduino
- 📫 You can reach me at Reddit as u/Ecstatic_Future_893
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm actually a self-taught 14 years old guy on how to do basic C++ that needs to be on a Arduino to work.
 And I'll accept any tips and tricks on how to make my C++ codes to be more space efficient and complex
